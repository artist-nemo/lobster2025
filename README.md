## What happended in 2019

[Comedian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian_(artwork)) is a 2019 artwork by Italian artist [Maurizio Cattelan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurizio_Cattelan). Created in an edition of three, it appears as a fresh banana affixed to a wall with duct tape.

As a work of conceptual art, it consists of a certificate of authenticity with detailed diagrams and instructions for its proper display.

Number two of the limited edition of three was sold to cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun for $6.2 million in November 2024. Soon afterward, he ate the banana onstage, comparing it to a crypto asset and saying, "the real value is the concept itself". Sun also stated that he would buy [100,000 bananas](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/justin-sun-offers-to-buy-100000-bananas-from-fruit-vendor-1234725335/) from the street vendor in front of Sotheby's who sold the banana used in the most recent refresh of the artwork.
