## What happended in 2019

[Comedian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian_(artwork)) is a 2019 artwork by Italian artist [Maurizio Cattelan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurizio_Cattelan). Created in an edition of three, it appears as a fresh banana affixed to a wall with duct tape.

As a work of conceptual art, it consists of a certificate of authenticity with detailed diagrams and instructions for its proper display (Art by Instruction).

Number two of the limited edition of three was sold to cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun for $6.2 million in November 2024. Soon afterward, he ate the banana onstage, comparing it to a crypto asset and saying, "the real value is the concept itself". Sun also stated that he would buy [100,000 bananas](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/justin-sun-offers-to-buy-100000-bananas-from-fruit-vendor-1234725335/) from the street vendor in front of Sotheby's who sold the banana used in the most recent refresh of the artwork.
